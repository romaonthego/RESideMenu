# RESideMenu

iOS 7 style side menu inspired by Dribbble shots ([first](http://dribbble.com/shots/1116265-Instasave-iPhone-App) and [second](http://dribbble.com/shots/1114754-Social-Feed-iOS7)).

## Requirements
* Xcode 4.5 or higher
* Apple LLVM compiler
* iOS 5.0 or higher
* ARC

## Demo

Build and run the `RESideMenuExample` project in Xcode to see `RESideMenu` in action.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

The recommended approach for installating `RESideMenu` is via the [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) package manager, as it provides flexible dependency management and dead simple installation.
For best results, it is recommended that you install via CocoaPods >= **0.15.2** using Git >= **1.8.0** installed via Homebrew.

Install CocoaPods if not already available:

``` bash
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
$ pod setup
```

Change to the directory of your Xcode project:

``` bash
$ cd /path/to/MyProject
$ touch Podfile
$ edit Podfile
```

Edit your Podfile and add RESideMenu:

``` bash
platform :ios, '6.0'
pod 'RESideMenu', '~> 2.0.2'
```

Install into your Xcode project:

``` bash
$ pod install
```

Open your project in Xcode from the .xcworkspace file (not the usual project file)

``` bash
$ open MyProject.xcworkspace
```

Please note that if your installation fails, it may be because you are installing with a version of Git lower than CocoaPods is expecting. Please ensure that you are running Git >= **1.8.0** by executing `git --version`. You can get a full picture of the installation details by executing `pod install --verbose`.

### Manual Install

All you need to do is drop `RESideMenu` files into your project, and add `#include "RESideMenu.h"` to the top of classes that will use it.

## Example Usage

``` objective-c
RESideMenuItem *homeItem = [[RESideMenuItem alloc] initWithTitle:@"Home" action:^(RESideMenu *menu, RESideMenuItem *item) {
    [menu hide];

    SecondViewController *secondViewController = [[SecondViewController alloc] init];
    secondViewController.title = item.title;
    UINavigationController *navigationController = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:secondViewController];

    // Use displayContentController to switch between view controllers
    //
    [menu displayContentController:navigationController];
}];
RESideMenuItem *exploreItem = [[RESideMenuItem alloc] initWithTitle:@"Explore" action:^(RESideMenu *menu, RESideMenuItem *item) {
    [menu hide];
}];

_sideMenu = [[RESideMenu alloc] initWithItems:@[homeItem, exploreItem]];
[_sideMenu show];
```

## Customization

You can customize the following properties of `RESideMenu`:

``` objective-c
@property (assign, readwrite, nonatomic) CGFloat verticalOffset;
@property (assign, readwrite, nonatomic) CGFloat horizontalOffset;
@property (assign, readwrite, nonatomic) CGFloat itemHeight;
@property (strong, readwrite, nonatomic) UIFont *font;
@property (strong, readwrite, nonatomic) UIColor *textColor;
@property (strong, readwrite, nonatomic) UIColor *highlightedTextColor;
@property (strong, readwrite, nonatomic) UIImage *backgroundImage;
@property (assign, readwrite, nonatomic) BOOL hideStatusBarArea;
```
